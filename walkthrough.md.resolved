# Website Domain Modification Walkthrough

## Overview
This walkthrough documents the process of replacing the domain `macmasterimaritime.com` with `pangminybm.com` and the site name `Macmasteri Maritime` with `Center Marine Certificate Service` across the entire website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automated Replacement Script
A Python script [modify_site.py](file:///d:/ypm/my%20web/test/modify_site.py) was created and executed to:
- Iterate through all files in the website directory.
- Replace text occurrences of the old domain and site name with the new ones.
- Handle variations of the site name (e.g., "MacMasteri", "MACMASTERI MARITIME").
- Rename directories containing the old domain.
- Clean up HTTrack comments.
- **Crucially**, the script was updated to handle files with no extension (found in `wp-json/oembed/`) to ensure complete coverage.

### 2. Directory Structure
- The main website directory has been renamed from `macmasterimaritime.com` to `pangminybm.com`.
- Internal directories containing the old domain name have also been renamed.

### 3. Content Updates
- **Meta Tags**: Title, description, and other meta tags in HTML files have been updated.
- **Links**: Internal links now point to the new domain.
- **JSON Data**: Embedded JSON data (oembed) has been scrubbed of the old name.

## Verification Results

### Automated Search
A comprehensive `grep` search was performed on the entire `pangminybm.com` directory:
- **Old Domain**: `macmasterimaritime.com` -> **0 matches found**
- **Old Name**: `MacMasteri` (case-insensitive) -> **0 matches found**

### Manual Verification Steps
To manually verify the changes:
1. Open [d:\ypm\my web\test\pangminybm.com\index.html](file:///ypm/my%20web/test/pangminybm.com/index.html) in your browser.
2. Check the page title and content to ensure "Center Marine Certificate Service" is displayed.
3. Inspect the source code (Right-click -> View Page Source) to verify meta tags and links.
4. Navigate to a few subpages to ensure links work and content is consistent.

## Next Steps
- Deploy the `pangminybm.com` directory to your web server.
- Perform a final live test to ensure all assets load correctly.
